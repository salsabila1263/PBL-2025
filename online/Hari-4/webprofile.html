    Based in Bandung, Indonesia, I am a recent graduate majoring in Environmental Health with a strong passion for public health and environmental safety. My academic background is supported by hands-on experience in HSE practices, sanitation systems, and pest control across diverse field settings.

    I have a proven ability to conduct hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRADC), perform environmental sampling, and deliver community health education with measurable impact. I am skilled in stakeholder coordination, regulatory compliance, and maintaining data accuracy — all while upholding a strong commitment to sustainability and public well-being.

    My strength lies in translating technical findings into actionable recommendations for both management and community stakeholders. I thrive in collaborative environments and bring a multidisciplinary approach to solving real-world challenges. In addition to my background in environmental health, I am currently developing my skills in web development and design.
